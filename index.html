   <p>
     Giles Corey (c. August 1611 – September 19, 1692) was an English-born 
     American farmer who was accused of witchcraft
     along with his wife Martha Corey during the Salem witch trials.
     After being arrested, Corey refused to enter a plea of guilty or not guilty.
     He was subjected to <a target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crushing_(execution)">pressing</a> in an effort to force him to
     plead—the only example of such a sanction in American history—and died 
     after three days of this torture.
